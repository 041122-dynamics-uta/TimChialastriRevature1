President's Day
First list out Monday through Friday and write down the five names. 
Then put Millard's birthday on Thursday.
Since Williams birthday is after Abe and John and Abe are two days apart that only leave Friday for William's birthday. 
That means Abe birthday is on Wednesday and John is on Monday. 
That leaves Tuesday for George which is also before Millard's.
