Summer Camp

Data & Logic:

1. Abigail’s favorite activity isn’t rock climbing. = Abigail likes to cook, kayak, or zip-line; does not like to rock climb
2. Oliver is afraid of heights. = Oliver likes to kayak or cook; does not like to rock climb or zip-line
3. Rosa can’t do her favorite activity without a harness. = Rosa likes to rock climb or zip-line; does not like to cook or kayak
4. Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times. = Blake likes to cook; does not like the other 3 activities
5. If cook is ruled out to Blake, then that means Oliver likes to kayak.
6. If kayak is ruled out to Oliver, then that means Abigail likes to zip-line.
7. If zip-line is ruled out to Abigail, then that means Rosa is left with the last activity, rock climb.
8. Therefore favorite activities are: Abigail = zip-line, Oliver = kayak, Rosa = rock climb, and Blake = cook
