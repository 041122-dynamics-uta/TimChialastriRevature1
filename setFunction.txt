Using the Set() function in Power Apps


What is the set function? The set function is a global variable which temporarily holds a piece of information, such as the number of times the user has selected a button or the result of a data operation.




How is it used? Set( myVariableName, <valueHere>)




When to use Set() as opposed to updateContext()? UpdateContext() should be used for one screen, but the Set() should be used if you are creating a variable for more than one screen.


Examples:         Set(Name, “John”)
                Set(Counter, 1)


                Also can be used for a single value, a record, a table, an object reference, or any result from a formula.
                
Set() could easily be used to increment a value in a shopping cart that may be redirected to multiple pages.
