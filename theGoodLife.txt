Good Life
First I list out the five activities at the top and put the dogs names going down to make a table. The first clue says Pepper is either playing catch or burying a toy. So I put a circle in those two spots and X out all the rest. Then it says Ginger, Saber, and Bear are not on walks so I X out all those spots. That leaves walk open for only Nutmeg so I put a circle there and X out all the other spots for Nutmeg. Next one dog that has a spice name is getting their ears scratched. Ginger is the only spice with an open spot for ear scratch so I put a circle there and X out the other spots for ginger. Next I went down to the last one that says Bear is getting exercise the only one open that is exercise is catch so bear is playing catch. That leaves burying a toy for Pepper and taking a nap for Saber.
